pacer-rss
=========

Script that reads PACER RSS feeds and looks for updates in selected cases.


It can then (optionally) send an email or post on twitter (designed
for unattended operation using cron, etc.) . This requires
certain command-line options to be set (use -h to see them).

NOTES:
The script expects files ./killswitch and ./lasttime.


This is in active development and should not be considered usable.
In fact, the latest version has not been tested at all.
