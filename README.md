pacer-rss
=========

Script that reads PACER RSS feeds and looks for updates in selected cases.


NOTES:
rss_scrape_redacted.py is my version of rss_scrape.py, just with my Gmail login details removed.
Eventually I'll find a way to remove my login details from the actual code :P.

The script expects files ./killswitch and ./lasttime. I'm not sure if it'll break if those aren't there.



This is in active development and should not be considered usable.
